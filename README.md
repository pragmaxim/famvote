# üó≥Ô∏è FamilyVote DApp

A lightweight decentralized voting app for family decisions, built with [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), Solidity, and a minimal [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend.

You can create polls like **"What‚Äôs for dinner?"** and allow only specific family members to vote. Results are stored and displayed on-chain.

```

3. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Connecting to Anvil

1. Start Anvil in a separate terminal:

```bash
anvil
```

  - Click on your account icon in Metamask
  - Select "Import Account"
  - Paste one of the private keys from the Anvil output
  - Click "Import"

3. Connect Metamask to the Anvil network:

  - RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545
  - Chain ID: 31337
  - Currency Symbol: ETH

4. Deploy the FamilyVote contract to Anvil:

```bash
# From the project root (not the frontend directory)
# Replace <PRIVATE_KEY> with one of the private keys from the Anvil output
# For example: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
forge create src/FamilyVote.sol:FamilyVote --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --broadcast
```

5. After successful deployment, you'll see output similar to:

Deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
Transaction hash: 0x...
```

6. Update the CONTRACT_ADDRESS in `frontend/src/hooks/useContract.js` with the deployed contract address:
```javascript
